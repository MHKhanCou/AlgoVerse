# ✅ Password Reset Issue Fixed - AlgoVerse

## 🔧 **Problem Identified**

**Issue**: Password reset was not working - no OTP emails were being sent when users tried to reset their password.

**Root Cause**: The frontend was still using the old token-based password reset system, but the backend was configured to send OTP-based emails. There was a mismatch between frontend expectations and backend implementation.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Created Modern OTP-Based Password Reset System**

**New Files Created**:
- `src/pages/OTPPasswordResetPage.jsx` - Complete 2-step OTP password reset page
- `src/styles/OTPPasswordReset.css` - Themed styling matching your app design

**Features**:
- ✅ **Step 1**: Enter 6-digit OTP code from email
- ✅ **Step 2**: Set new password with validation
- ✅ **Real-time countdown timer** (10 minutes)
- ✅ **Auto-advance OTP inputs** with paste support
- ✅ **Resend functionality** with rate limiting
- ✅ **Perfect theme integration** using your CSS variables

### **2. Updated Frontend Flow**

**Modified Files**:
- `src/pages/ForgotPasswordPage.jsx` - Now redirects to OTP reset page
- `src/App.jsx` - Added new route `/reset-password-otp`

**New Flow**:
```
1. User enters email on "Forgot Password" page
2. Backend sends 6-digit OTP to email  
3. User redirected to OTP password reset page
4. User enters OTP → Move to password setup
5. User sets new password → Success & redirect to login
```
